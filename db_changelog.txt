added grenades as a default weapon. Removed crossbow.
added custom leech model.
rede2: fixed missing custom models on dead grunts. Fixed missing text on the sat part.
rede6: modified the truck part at map start because i felt the entities system was unreliable. modified the warehouse elevator area, now you have to go all the way around using the stairs and not jumping over the boxes. Renamed to rede6_1.
rede7: modified the npc spawning order for better efficiency.
rede8: added an rpg to make it easier to destroy the apache. Simplified env_beam entities due to performance issues.
rede_db1: modified the scan laser doors to make them more user friendly. Fixed dying barney failing to play his almost dead animation sometimes.
rede_db2: added some missing sounds. Added extra info_nodes to keep barney from being stuck on certain circunstances.
due to a bug in trigger_changesky entities some maps will be divided as a temporary solution: rede1_a,rede2_a,rede2_b,rede6_1_a,rede8_a added. Hopefully this bug will be fixed in SC 5.26 and this change will be reverted.
